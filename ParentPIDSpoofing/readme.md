# Parent PID spoofing
- This is a simple method to bypass malicious behavior detections based on parent-child process relationship. Usually when an application starts another executable, the new process has a parent PID assigned which indicates the process that created it.

This technique may be combined with for example process hollowing to achieve more stealth.

- The great thing is that CreateProcess API lets you provide additional information for process creation, including the one called PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS. Letâ€™s see how to use it - we will create a Powershell process in a way that it will look like it was spawned by explorer.exe:
